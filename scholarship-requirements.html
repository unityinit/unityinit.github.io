						<p>We have two different scholarships available, one of them is through <b>UCI</b>  
						which will have two potential winners and the other is in partnership with <b>PowerBlanket</b> 
						which will also have two potential winners. Below is the requirements for both, read each 
						carefully to understand the criteria and submit your applications to <b>ucinitiative@gmail.com</b> 
						by the given dates.</p>
						
						<h3><u>Community Scholarship</u></h3>
							
						<p>There are two $500 scholarships available for 2019 through UCI. The closing date is 
					        Saturday, November 30th, with the winners announced Monday, January 6th, 2020. Payment 
					        will be deposited into winners accounts. To apply, follow the steps below:<br><br> 

						<b>1. You must be seeking higher-education beyond high school (trade school, 4-year 
						college, community college, etc.). You must include your name, and what school 
						you are attending.</b> <br><br>

						<b>2. Choose one of these two topics:</b><br>

						<li> If you were given $1 million, what program(s) would you develop for teens
						in impoverished communities so they do not become “at-risk”?</li><br>

						<li>How can we motivate the rising generation (18-35) to give back and become more 
						involved in their communities? What obstacles are there and how can we overcome 
						them?</li><br>
							
						<b>3. There is no specific format that must be followed or word count. However, 
						answering the topics in your report must do the following below:</b> <br><br>
							
						<li> Must be logical and attainable. If your idea is completely unrealistic you
						will not move forward in the process. We are looking for ideas the can be implemented
						immediately, not years down the line.</li>
							
						<li> Your idea must be sustainable. If it is a quick fix, or a one time event that
						will be short lived you will not move forward in the process. We are looking for
						sustainability and will continue for years to come.</li></p>
