					<p>
				
					The purpose of the mentorship program is to help those seeking the opportunity 
					to get a leg-up in their career through shadowing and receiving training through 
					a mentor in their field of choice. The mentor will help guide and teach you about 
					their field of expertise through techniques, programs, ideas, pros, and cons, etc. 
					With potential networking possibilities and skills gained this is a great opportunity 
					for those wanting to learn more, struggling to find internships, or getting the training 
					they need. <br><br> 

					Below is a list of potential mentors to choose from, you can be local or remote but ultimately 
					they decide. If there is someone you see that may be a fit, email us their name, who you are, where 
					you are at, what you are hoping to learn and anything else you may wish to say. We will then contact 
					them to see if they can take you on or not due to their schedule. No internship or job is promised. 
					We will also keep in contact with you monthly to see how things are going, skills gained, internship/job 
					offer, etc. until you are done with your mentor or an internship/job is offered. <br><br>
