						<h3>About UCI and our Goal</h3>
						<p>Unity Community Initiative (UCI) started as the brainchild of college senior, 
                                                Dylan Howard, who was looking for a way to empower future students and communities. 
						The purpose of UCI is to influence the upcoming generation to become law-abiding 
						citizens that give back to their community and country. By helping stimulate young minds to 
						be an influential part of their community and give back, Unity Community Initiative will help 
						communities unite and progress through grassroot movements.<br><br> 

                                               <b>How We Accomplish Our Goal:</b><br>
						<div class="row">	
						<div class="col-sm-9">
                                               <p>We accomplish our goal by providing stimulating scholarships to young college 
					       students that require them to research and provide a way that will benefit a
					       specific city or community. After a winner is chosen, we give them the 
					       opportunity to see their idea come to fruition if within our means.</P
